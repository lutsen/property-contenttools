Lagan Contenttools Property Controller
======================================

Controller for the Lagan [Contenttools](http://getcontenttools.com/) property. Contenttools lets the user edit content directly in the website. The [Sirius upload handler library](https://github.com/siriusphp/upload) is used to upload images.

**Note**: To use this property controller, modifications of routes and templates are also needed! (And documentation on how to do that is also needed, sorry, working on it...)

To be used with [Lagan](https://github.com/lutsen/lagan). Lagan lets you create flexible content objects with a simple class, and manage them with a web interface.

Lagan is a project of [LÃºtsen Stellingwerff](http://lutsen.net/).
